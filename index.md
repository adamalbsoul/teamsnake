# Rules
Players shuffle the cards and then each player takes **1 character card**. The character card determines the player character. There are 4 characters- **Human, Zombie, Fairy,** and **Snake**. The players keep it a secret which character they are.

There is a seperate deck with smaller cards, called the **deck of shame**.

## Accusing
If a player suspects that another player is **bluffing**, he/she can call him/her out. The acccused player must then **reveal their card**.

If the accuser was right about the bluff, the accused player skips a turn and takes a slip out of the deck of shame to read out **loud**.
If the accuser was wrong, the accuser skips a turn and takes a slip out of the deck of shame to read out **loud**.

In both cases, the accused player shows their card and takes a new card from the deck.

## Characters:

**Fairy**: When you roll a 1 move 6 squares, When you roll a 6 move 1 square


**Human**: Climbs up ladders, Falls down snake heads


**Snake**: Climbs up tails of snakes, Falls down ladders


**Zombie**: Ignore both snakes and ladders, but you can't move if you roll a 4, 5 or 6

## Bonus rule:
When a 6 is rolled all the character cards are shuffled.

### “Do you believe in aliens, because I’m about to hit that bathroom and abduct a giant turd.”
---
### “If you tickle me, I will say hee hee and prance around like a rainbow lollipop on a cloud of unicorn wishes.”
---
### “Something inside of me tells me we should be together, but lucky for you i never listen to the advice my duodenum gives me because it’s full of crap.”
---
### “Fart-burps shine on all of us, don’t they?”
---
### “Excuse me, would you mind if we touched palms right now so that the heel of my hand touched the heel of your hand and all of our finger pads were touching each other?”
---
### "Potatoes have skin. I have skin. Therefore, I am a potato."
