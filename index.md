# Rules
Players shuffle the cards and then each player takes 1 card. The card determines the team that the player belongs to. There are 2 teams- Human and Snake. Each team has their distinct ability. The players keep it a secret which team they are. The other players have to guess which team the player that played the turn is in. If they are wrong, the cards get reshuffled and players pick their cards again.
